# Crossroads
Mod Loader for Hollow Knight

CURRENTLY WIP - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

To build: Requires at least Unity 2017.3.1f1

When it's run it will attempt to find your hollow knight folder. 
Then it will allow automated downloading and installing of hollow knight mods.

# TODO:

  * (Done) Used the now tracked mod files install information to uninstall mods
  * (Done) Manage mod dependencies and conflicts
  * Add support for backing up saves
  * Add support for manual game/install path setting
  * Add support for canceling downloads
  * Add GOG version links and differentiate between steam/GOG mods.
  * Display mod authors and version information
  * Display/Check mod versions and links
  * Display mod readme files in a viewer

...and more?
