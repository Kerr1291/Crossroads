# Crossroads
Mod Loader for Hollow Knight

CURRENTLY WIP - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

To build: Requires at least Unity 2017.3.1f1

When it's run it will attempt to find your hollow knight folder. 
Then it will allow automated downloading and installing of hollow knight mods.

# TODO:

  * (Done) Backup files before mod installation
  * Used the now tracked mod files install information to uninstall mods
  * Manage mod dependencies and conflicts
  * Display mod readme files in a viewer

...and more?


Feel free to try the current release, it should work on Windows 7 or 10.
