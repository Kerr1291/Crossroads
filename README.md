# Crossroads
Crossroads: Mod Loader for Hollow Knight (v0.51, Windows 7/10 support)

This application allows for automatic installation and uninstallation of mods for Hollow Knight. Simply run this application and after it loads, select the mods you wish to install/uninstall and click "Apply Changes".

If it does not automatically detect your Hollow Knight game folder, use the button to navigate to the folder and select it manually.

Any mod dependencies will be downloaded automatically. If a mod conflicts with another mod, that mod will be uninstalled before installing the new mod.

Use the "Backup Saves" button to backup your hollow knight saves and the "Restore Saves" button to restore your hollow knight saves.
